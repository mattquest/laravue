Laravue Spa pulls together Laravel, Vue.js and Vuetify.  Under the hood, it's all Laravel 6 on the backend with it's built in user authentication features.  The front end is built with vuex, vue-router and the beautiful Vuetify.js component library.

Laravue Spa is designed to be flexible, lightweight and extensible.  
* any core component can be overwritten 
* the main vuex store is easily extended
* routes and menu items are defined as properties of Vue components
* "global scoped" mixins allow the placement of mixins on all project components without contaminating imported library components
